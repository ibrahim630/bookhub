* Here are some important details about the code structure:

* The main code is in the "lib" folder, with "main.dart" serving as the launch point.
* The "screens" folder contains the various paths of the application, while the "components" folder houses files pertaining to basic functionality used across pages.
* The "courses" folder contains files on all course-related content.
* The "admincontrol" folder contains files regarding user details and login.
* Firebase is utilized for the backend, and "pubspec.yaml" lists all the application dependencies.
* The "android" and "ios" folders are automatically generated by Flutter.
* Flutter uses Dart to construct the app in its respective platform, utilizing nested widgets for layout.
* To run the application, you must install Flutter and an emulator for either Android or iOS. The following link provides instructions for your development platform: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

* Finally, to view your changes in real-time, hot reload Flutter, which will immediately reflect your modifications on your emulator instead of having to rebuild the whole project.
